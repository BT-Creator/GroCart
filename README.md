# Introduction
Welcome to the **Grocart** Repository, powered by **[Laravel](https://laravel.com/)**, the PHP framework for Web Artisans.

Grocart is a remote shopping service that allows you to keep track of the groceries you need and order them with ease, thanks to our list system.
## Before we dive in...
This repo contains the consumer side of the application. If a link links to the *Under Construction* page, this means that the page was out-of-scope for this project.
